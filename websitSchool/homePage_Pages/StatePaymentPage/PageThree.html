                ASD, a member of the International Schools Group (ISG), operates as a not-for-profit organization within
                the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, boasting a rich history of over fifty years. In the realm of international
                education, the not-for-profit model stands as the highest standard, with all generated revenue being
                reinvested back into the school. This approach signifies a commitment to excellence in education, as the
                school prioritizes the continual improvement of resources and facilities for the benefit of its students
                and the broader community, rather than pursuing financial gains.</p>
